Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions, Astronomy, History of Magic, and Herbology were compulsory subjects for the first five years. At the end of their second year, students were required to add at least two optional subjects to their syllabus for the start of the third year.

          <h1>Charms</h1>
          <p>Charms were a type of spells concerned with giving an object new and unexpected properties, and hence
            this class mainly consisted of learning those sorts of spells. Charms was a required subject for all students in their first five years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The spells learned in Charms class were taken from textbooks. Students were taught specific wand movements and proper pronunciation. Often students partnered up in class to experiment on one another. Charms was Hermione Granger's favourite subject,until she started Arithmancy as an elective in 1993. In a student's fifth year they took the Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations. This exam contained a written portion and a practical portion. The written portion was made up of questions concerning the theory of charms and the practical was where students were judged upon the charms they could perform.</p>

          <h1>Defence Against the Dark Arts</h1>
          <p>Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A., was the class that taught students
            defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts, and to be protected from dark creatures.The class was a core subject at Hogwarts.The position of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at the school was once rumoured to be jinxed, as no teacher could hold the post for more than a year without suffering an unpleasant fate. Tom Riddle jinxed the position because Albus Dumbledore did not give him the job when he applied for it.The fact that no teacher has lasted longer than a year meant that the subject had numerous Professors over the years.
            Ilvermorny began teaching the subject in the 17th century. Harry Potter would occasionally deliver Defence Against the Dark Arts lectures at Hogwarts in his adulthood.</p>

            <h1>Transfiguration</h1>
            <p>Transfiguration was the art of changing the form or appearance of an object, and hence this was what this
              class taught. Transfiguration was a theory-based subject, including topics such as "Switching Spells"
              (altering only a part of some object, such as giving a human rabbit's ears). This type of magic was commonly referred to as "Transfiguration" and was considered both complex and dangerous.
              There were limits to Transfiguration, which were governed by Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration. There were also many branches of Transfiguration, including Trans-Species Transformation and Human Transfiguration. This type of magic was regarded as "very hard work" and was "more scientific" than charms-work, as one had to get it exactly right for the transfiguration to be successful.
              The professor of this subject for many years was Albus Dumbledore and later Minerva McGonagall. It is unknown who the teacher was before Professor Dumbledore and who took over when Professor McGonagall became headmistress of Hogwarts.</p>
