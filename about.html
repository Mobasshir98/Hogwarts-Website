          <h1>World's Best School Of Witchcraft & Wizardry</h1>
          <p>
            Established around the 10th century, Hogwarts was considered to be
            one of the finest magical institutions in the wizarding world,
            though other notable schools included Beauxbatons Academy of Magic
            in France, the Durmstrang Institute implied to be in northern
            Europe, and Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the
            United States.Children with magical abilities were enrolled at
            birth, and acceptance was confirmed by owl post at age eleven. <br> <br> The primary mode of transport to Hogwarts is the Hogwarts Express that students take at the start of each school year. Students board the train from  Platform 9Â¾ at King's Cross station in London. The train arrives at Hogsmeade station near Hogwarts, some time after nightfall.
            From there, first-year students are accompanied by the "Keeper of the Keys, Game and Grounds" to small boats, which magically sail across the lake and get them near the entrance of Hogwarts. The older students ride up to the castle in carriages pulled by creatures called Thestrals. When the first-year students initially arrive at the castle, they wait in a small chamber off the entrance hall until the older students have taken their seats, and then enter the Great Hall for the Sorting Ceremony to determine their House assignments.
